# Nils Design Patterns
All uses Nils Streams and Functions
- Functions need to do 1 thing
- Code needs to follow Self Documented Code Patterns.
- Manage Loading and Imports via webcomponent and not your init html
- Init HTML needs to Provide full filled first viewport
- WebComponent Scripts if they are not Loader only Scripts should get loaded always in template
